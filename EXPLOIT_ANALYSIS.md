## Detailed Attack Scenarios

### 1. Oracle Manipulation Attack üéØ

**Target**: Price feed manipulation for maximum profit extraction

**Method**:
1. Monitor for large pending transactions or liquidations
2. Submit transaction to manipulate price oracle before target transaction
3. Extract value through arbitrage opportunities
4. Restore price to capture profit

**Real-World Example**:
```solidity
// Attacker detects pending liquidation of $1M position
// Manipulates WETH price feed down 3%
// Liquidates position at discount
// Restores price and profits from difference
// Net profit: ~$30K (3% of liquidated amount)
```

**Profitability Analysis**:
- **Cost**: Gas fees (~$50-200) + MEV bid
- **Revenue**: 1-5% of manipulated position size
- **Break-even**: $10K+ position size
- **Optimal conditions**: High volatility, large positions

### 2. Liquidation MEV Attack ‚ö°

**Target**: Front-running liquidations for maximum value extraction

**Method**:
1. Monitor credit accounts approaching liquidation threshold
2. Front-run liquidation transactions
3. Execute liquidation at maximum discount
4. Immediately sell collateral at market price

**Real-World Example**:
```solidity
// Large credit account with $2M collateral drops to 85% health factor
// Attacker front-runs liquidation transaction
// Liquidates $500K collateral at 5% discount
// Immediately sells at market price
// Net profit: $25K (5% discount on $500K)
```

**Profitability Analysis**:
- **Cost**: Gas fees + priority fee for front-running
- **Revenue**: Liquidation discount (typically 2-8%)
- **Break-even**: $5K+ liquidation size
- **Optimal conditions**: Market stress, large positions

### 3. Flash Loan Arbitrage Attack üí∞

**Target**: Exploit price discrepancies using massive borrowed capital

**Method**:
1. Identify price discrepancies between Gearbox and external protocols
2. Execute flash loan for maximum available amount
3. Buy underpriced assets on one protocol
4. Sell at higher price on another protocol
5. Repay flash loan and keep profit

**Real-World Example**:
```solidity
// USDC trading at $0.98 on Gearbox, $1.00 on Uniswap
// Flash loan $10M USDC
// Convert to assets on Gearbox at discount
// Sell on Uniswap at full price
// Net profit: $200K (2% on $10M volume)
```

**Profitability Analysis**:
- **Cost**: Flash loan fees (0.05-0.3%) + gas
- **Revenue**: Price spread √ó flash loan amount
- **Break-even**: 0.5%+ price discrepancy
- **Optimal conditions**: Market volatility, liquidity imbalances

### 4. Collateral Calculation Exploit üîß

**Target**: Edge cases in collateral valuation logic

**Method**:
1. Identify timing windows in collateral calculations
2. Manipulate token balances during calculation
3. Exploit rounding errors or edge cases
4. Extract value from calculation discrepancies

**Profitability Analysis**:
- **Cost**: Gas fees + setup transactions
- **Revenue**: Calculation errors √ó position size
- **Break-even**: Requires specific conditions
- **Optimal conditions**: Protocol upgrades, edge cases

### 5. Permission Escalation Attack üîì

**Target**: Access control bypasses for unlimited access

**Method**:
1. Analyze permission checks and access controls
2. Attempt to bypass role-based restrictions
3. Escalate to admin-level privileges
4. Extract maximum value before detection

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Funds at Risk**: Unlimited (if successful)
- **Success Likelihood**: Very Low (well-tested contracts)
- **Detection**: Immediate (if attempted)
- **Legal Risk**: Criminal charges

### 6. Cross-Protocol Arbitrage Attack üåê

**Target**: Price inefficiencies between DeFi protocols

**Method**:
1. Monitor prices across multiple protocols
2. Identify arbitrage opportunities
3. Execute trades to capture price differences
4. Scale with available capital

**Real-World Example**:
```solidity
// ETH price: $2000 on Gearbox, $2020 on Uniswap
// Buy 1000 ETH on Gearbox for $2M
// Sell 1000 ETH on Uniswap for $2.02M
// Net profit: $20K (1% spread)
```

### 7. Sandwich Liquidation Attack ü•™

**Target**: Combine sandwich attacks with liquidation mechanics

**Method**:
1. Detect pending liquidation transactions
2. Front-run with price manipulation
3. Execute liquidation at manipulated price
4. Back-run to restore price and capture profit

**Profitability Analysis**:
- **Cost**: Gas fees + MEV protection costs
- **Revenue**: Price manipulation + liquidation discount
- **Break-even**: $50K+ liquidation
- **Optimal conditions**: Low liquidity, large liquidations

### 8. Advanced Token Manipulation üé≠

**Target**: Complex multi-token coordination attacks

**Method**:
1. Coordinate across multiple collateral tokens
2. Exploit token interaction edge cases
3. Time attacks with protocol operations
4. Extract value from complex interactions

## Economic Impact Analysis

### Direct Financial Impact

**Immediate Losses**:
- User liquidations at unfavorable prices
- Protocol reserves depleted through exploits
- Collateral value manipulation losses

**Systemic Risks**:
- Confidence loss leading to bank runs
- Liquidity provider withdrawals

| **Medium Positions ($100K-$1M)** | Break-even | Profitable | Very Profitable | Extremely Profitable |
| **Large Positions (>$1M)** | Profitable | Very Profitable | Extremely Profitable | Maximum Profit |

   - Chainlink price feeds with heartbeat monitoring

2. **Liquidation Protection**:
   - Liquidation delays
   - Minimum liquidation sizes
   - Progressive liquidation discounts
   - MEV protection mechanisms

3. **Access Control**:
   - Multi-signature requirements
   - Time-locked admin functions
   - Role-based permissions
   - Emergency pause mechanisms

4. **Economic Safeguards**:
   - Reserve funds for emergency situations
   - Insurance fund for user protection
   - Maximum position size limits
   - Dynamic risk parameters

### Monitoring and Detection

1. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Large position tracking
   - Price deviation alerts
   - Unusual transaction patterns

3. **Flash loan arbitrage** using massive capital
4. **Cross-protocol** price discrepancies

**Key Findings**:
- Attacks are most profitable during high market volatility
- Large positions ($1M+) offer the highest profit potential
- Flash loan access significantly amplifies attack capabilities
- Current security measures may not be sufficient for all scenarios

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement comprehensive MEV protection
2. Enhance oracle manipulation resistance
3. Add flash loan attack detection
4. Strengthen emergency response procedures
5. Establish continuous monitoring systems

This analysis provides the foundation for enhancing protocol security and protecting user funds against sophisticated attack vectors.
